# Next.js

Next.js is a **React-based framework from Vercel** that lets you ship high-performance web apps with minimal configuration.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Pages are rendered on the server per request – perfect for dynamic content and SEO.  
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pages are pre-rendered at build time and served as static assets via CDN – lightning fast.  
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Regenerate static pages on demand or on a schedule without a full rebuild.  
- **App & Pages Router:** Choose the classic Pages Router or the modern App Router with React Server Components.  
- **File-based routing:** Every file in `app` or `pages` automatically becomes a route.  
- **API routes & edge functions:** Deploy serverless back-end logic right next to your front-end code.  
- **Automatic code splitting & image optimisation:** Faster page loads out of the box – no manual tweaks required.  

**Bottom line**: faster Time-to-Interactive, better SEO and less boilerplate – all without heavy setup.
