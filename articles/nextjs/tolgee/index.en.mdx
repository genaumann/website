# Tolgee

Tolgee is a **complete localization platform** that covers the entire lifecycle of your translations—from string management to live in-context editing.  
Thanks to its SDK, CLI and REST API, Tolgee fits into virtually any tech stack.

- **In-context translation:** Edit texts directly inside the running application.  
- **Machine suggestions:** Accept DeepL, Google, Azure, etc. with a single click.  
- **Translation memory:** Automatically reuses existing phrasing.  
- **Automatic screenshots:** Every string gets a UI snapshot.  
- **Self-hosted or cloud:** Docker Compose in < 1 min, or use the hosted SaaS.  
- **SDKs:** React, Angular, Vue 3, vanilla JS, iOS, Android, Flutter, …  

Each string is referenced by a **key** that you maintain in Tolgee.  
At runtime Tolgee ships all strings as compact JSON files that your app loads on demand.

## How it works in Next.js

With `@tolgee/react` you can integrate Tolgee into Next.js in minutes.

Tolgee supports both the **App Router** and the **Pages Router** and works on the client as well as on the server (RSC).

  <TabItem title="Development Environment">
    In development mode translations are loaded **live** from the Tolgee API.  
    
    - UI changes are visible instantly (hot reload).  
    - No cache — you always see the latest state.  
    - Perfect for in-context editing.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem title="Preview & Production Environment">
    For preview and production builds Tolgee recommends its **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**.  
    
    - All translations are served as static JSON files from an edge cache.  
    - Ultra-fast delivery (< 30 ms worldwide).  
    - No auth token required, so the attack surface is reduced.

    <Admonition variant="success" title="GDPR-compliant setup">
      By default, the browser also fetches directly from the CDN — exposing your visitors’ IP addresses to Tolgee.  
      The following article shows how to **route all CDN traffic through your own Next.js server**, achieving full GDPR compliance.
