# Multiple Git identities

Each Git commit contains information about the author of the commit, among other things.
A person's real name and email address are usually set as the Git identity.

Git offers the option of setting up multiple identities per user.
This means, for example, that private projects can be committed with the private e-mail address.
Projects in a business context can be committed with the business e-mail address.

In the following examples, the configuration file `~/.gitconfig` is edited.

## Identity per path

The identity can be set per path.
In the following example, the directory structure under `~/projects` is used:

```txt
projects
├── private
└── work
```

The configuration file `~/.gitconfig` can look like this:

```ini variant='file' filePath='~/.gitconfig' id='gitconfig'
[includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/work/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work
[includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/private/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-private
```

<Tabs id="projects">
  <TabItem title="Project in <code>~/projects/work</code>">

If a Git project is located under `~/projects/work/project1`, then the Git config `~/.gitconfig-work` is used.
The business identity can be created within this configuration file.

```ini variant='file' filePath='~/.gitconfig-work' id='gitconfig-work'
[user]
    email = claire.grube@work.example.com
    name = "Claire Grube"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem title="Project in <code>~/projects/private</code>">
If a Git project is located under `~/projects/private/project1`, then the Git config `~/.gitconfig-private` is used.
The private identity can be created within this configuration file.

```ini variant='file' filePath='~/.gitconfig-private' id='gitconfig-private'
[user]
    email = claire.grube@private.example.com
    name = "Claire Grube"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
