# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows individuals and teams to track changes to files in a project over time.
Originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has quickly established itself as the standard solution for software development.
It supports parallel working through branching and merging, provides troubleshooting mechanisms and allows users to view the entire history of a project or revert to a previous version.
