# Salt

SaltStack (salt) is an open source tool for automating and managing IT infrastructures.
It is primarily used for configuration management, remote execution of commands and system automation.
Salt is based on a master/minion architecture in which the master assumes central control tasks and the minions represent the managed systems.
Configuration is carried out via YAML-based state files (SLS), which can be used to describe the desired system state declaratively.
In addition to agent-based communication, Salt also offers agentless operation via SSH.
Thanks to its high scalability, Salt is particularly suitable for large IT environments with many servers.
It not only enables automated software installations and configuration changes, but also fast, parallel execution of commands on multiple systems.
Thanks to its modular structure, Salt can be flexibly expanded and adapted to individual requirements.

<Admonition variant="danger" title="Current status of Salt">
The current status of Salt is unclear.
Salt is currently still receiving bug fixes, but no new features.

For a new installation or migration, I would currently rely on [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).
