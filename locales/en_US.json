        "typescript": "I now use TypeScript almost daily to develop websites (front and backend) and to use the end-to-end test framework Playwright.\n\n\nTypecript can be used both in the frontend and backend and offers robust typing with the support of modern IDEs.",
        "react": "I now develop all my web projects exclusively using React.\n\nI started my first React project back in 2021, when I built an early, unpublished alpha version of this website. At the time, I used Create React App (CRA) to set up the project.",
        "container": "I had heard a lot about Docker / Podman and containers in the past but didn’t really understand what they were all about.\nIn 2021, I made it a goal to dive into the world of containers—and quickly became fascinated by the technology.\n\nToday, I build and use containers in GitLab CI/CD pipelines and for running small services in my private homelab.",
        "git": "Whether I'm developing a web project or configuring IT infrastructure – Git is an essential tool I rely on every day.\n\nGiven its importance, I’ve also trained former colleagues on various Git-related topics.",
        "python": "In system administration, Python is a widely used language with a strong community.\nTools like Salt and Ansible are written in Python.\n\nI use Python to develop custom Salt modules and scripts for general system management.",
        "uyuni": "In 2023, I had my first hands-on experience with Uyuni / SUSE Manager—a tool that uses Salt for server management.\n\nAs part of a client project, I extended SUSE Manager and Salt to support an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach and implement a staging concept.",
        "salt": "I discovered and quickly grew to love Salt back in 2015 during my IT training.\nSince then, I’ve successfully completed several Salt projects - with great enthusiasm.\n\nWhile the community isn’t as active as it once was, Salt still plays a key role in managing my homelab every single day.",
        "ansible": "I first got in touch with Ansible in 2021.\nTo ensure high-quality playbooks and modules, I set up automated testing against virtual machines.\n\nAs a direct competitor to Salt, Ansible still benefits from a highly active community—which is why I’d now prefer Ansible over Salt.",
        "gitlab": "I first started working with GitLab in 2020—back then, I was mainly responsible for keeping the system up to date.\n\nIn 2021, I became deeply interested in its CI/CD features and quickly learned how to use them effectively.\n\nGitLab also holds personal significance for me.\nFor the past two years, I’ve been regularly conducting GitLab training sessions.",
        "github": "After gaining solid expertise in GitLab, I ventured into GitHub and tested its CI/CD features—which I found quite good.\nStill, I prefer GitLab's CI/CD capabilities overall.\n\nHowever, I currently manage my web projects on GitHub—mainly because of its seamless integration with Vercel.",
        "awx": "I first thoroughly tested the automation platform AWX—also known as Ansible Automation Platform—in 2023 and later used it in client projects.\n\nTo quickly spin up clean test environments, I automated the AWX installation using a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.",
        "linux": "I first gained experience with Linux—especially Debian—during my vocational training.\n\nI quickly became comfortable with the system and soon started giving Debian training sessions.\nToday, I have advanced skills in Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Fedora, and openSUSE.",
        "icinga2": "Shortly after completing my it training, I was tasked with replacing the outdated Nagios system with a modern Icinga2 setup.\n\nSince then, I’ve been using Icinga2 continuously—especially to monitor the servers in my homelab.",
        "playwright": "I started working with Playwright in 2024 while implementing end-to-end tests for Next.js web projects.\n\nTo match the Next.js stack, I use TypeScript for testing the applications. The tests were run automatically in a GitHub pipeline before the web application was deployed.",
        "nextjs": "I started my first React projects using Create React App (CRA).\nWhen the framework became outdated, I switched to Next.js—and haven’t looked back since.\n\nToday, I rely exclusively on Next.js for all web projects, with hosting handled via the Vercel platform.\nThis very website is also built with Next.js and hosted on Vercel."
