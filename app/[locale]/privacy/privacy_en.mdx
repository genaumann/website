### General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website

If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9(1) GDPR. In the event of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also based on ยง 25(1) TDDDG.

### Recipients of Personal Data

In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties.  
It is sometimes necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties.  
We only pass on personal data if this is necessary for contract performance, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.

### Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke any consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME, ON GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, INCLUDING PROFILING BASED ON THOSE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).

In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

### Right to Data Portability

You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.

### Access, Rectification, and Erasure

Within the framework of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing, and, if applicable, a right to rectification or erasure of this data.

### Right to Restrict Processing

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.  
To do so, you can contact us at any time.  
The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.
- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.
- If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data may โ apart from their storage โ only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

### Cookies

Our websites use so-called โcookies.โ Cookies are small data packets that do not harm your device.  
They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit.

Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services from third-party companies within websites (e.g., cookies for handling payment services).  
Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos).  
Other cookies can be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.  
Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process, to provide certain functions you have requested (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or to optimize the website (e.g., cookies to measure the web audience) are stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified.  
The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services.

Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.

### Contact Form

If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions.  
We do not pass on these data without your consent.  
The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.  
In all other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR), if this was requested; consent can be revoked at any time.  
The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your inquiry has been processed).  
Mandatory statutory provisions โ in particular retention periods โ remain unaffected.

### Vercel Web Analytics

This website uses Vercel Web Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Vercel Inc., for anonymized evaluation of user behavior. The analysis is performed **without the use of cookies** and without storing personal data such as full IP addresses or individual user IDs.  
Instead, a pseudonymous hash is generated from technically necessary information such as the IP address and user agent, used solely to count unique page visits.  
The collected data includes, among other things, information about accessed URLs, devices used, browsers, and countries (based on IP geolocation), but does **not** allow conclusions about individual persons.  
Storage takes place exclusively in aggregated form. Personal information (e.g., e-mail addresses or IDs in URLs) is not processed. Tracking is configured to ensure that no sensitive data is transmitted.  
The legal basis for processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the statistical evaluation to improve website stability, security, and performance.

### Vercel Speed Insights

To analyze our websiteโs performance, we also use "Speed Insights" by Vercel.  
This tool measures so-called "Core Web Vitals" (e.g., loading time, interactivity, layout shifts) on an anonymous basis and transmits the measurement data directly from the browser to Vercel's infrastructure. Individual users are **not** identified.  
The data helps us improve the loading speed and user experience of the site.  
Again, no cookies are used and no personal data is stored permanently.  
The legal basis for processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in technical optimization of the website).
