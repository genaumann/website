# Automated Deployment of AWX on k3s

## project_overview

In several customer projects, our team regularly installed and configured **AWX instances**.
However, due to the lack of a stable test environment, testing and experimentation were time-consuming and error-prone.
The goal was to fully automate the deployment of AWX — both in **single-node** and **multi-node** setups.

## challenge

Manually setting up AWX was complex and required multiple steps, especially in Kubernetes environments.
Additionally, the solution needed to be reproducible and easily integrated into existing CI/CD workflows.

- No centralized test setup for AWX
- High manual effort for each installation
- Missing automation and standardization

## goals

The main objectives of the project were:

- Fully automate the installation and setup of AWX
- Support **k3s single-node** and optional **multi-node** deployments
- Integrate the process into a **GitLab CI/CD pipeline**
- Provide a fast and reproducible test environment for the team

## approach

I developed an **Ansible playbook** combined with **CI/CD pipeline steps** in GitLab, which automatically provisions a k3s cluster and installs AWX on top of it.
This enabled the team to deploy a fully functional AWX environment within minutes, including all required dependencies and configurations.

## implementation

- **Cluster Setup:** Automated provisioning of a k3s cluster via GitLab CI
- **AWX Deployment:** Installation and configuration of AWX using Ansible
- **Pipeline Automation:** CI/CD pipeline for automated build and provisioning
- **Flexibility:** Support for both single-node and multi-node environments
- **Team Enablement:** Documentation and training to ensure easy adoption by the team

## results

- Fully functional AWX test environments deployed within minutes
- Consistent and reproducible deployments
- Significant reduction in manual effort
- Faster testing and development cycles

## insights

This project deepened my knowledge of **AWX deployments**, **k3s architectures**, and **CI/CD automation**.

- Experience in automated AWX installations on k3s
- Integration of CI/CD processes for infrastructure provisioning
- Building efficient and reproducible test environments for system engineers
