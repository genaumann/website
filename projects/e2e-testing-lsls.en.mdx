# Development and Integration of End-to-End Tests

## project_overview

My task was to perform **end-to-end testing of web applications** and integrate these tests into **GitHub Actions**.
The goal was to ensure that all applications were automatically tested for functionality before each deployment.
The tests covered different components, such as the **login process**, **payment workflows**, and other core features.

## challenge

The main challenge was to automate reliable testing of existing web applications, eliminating the need for manual verification.
This required developing stable test cases and integrating them into an existing CI/CD pipeline.

- Creation of robust end-to-end test cases
- Integration of automated test execution in GitHub Actions
- Reduction of manual QA steps before deployment

## goals

The goals of the project were:

- Develop and implement **E2E tests** for multiple web applications
- Integrate the tests into the existing **CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions**
- Ensure automatic test execution before every deployment
- Improve overall quality and reliability of the web applications

## approach

I developed the end-to-end tests using **Playwright** to realistically simulate user interactions.
These tests were then automated through **GitHub Actions**, allowing every repository change to trigger test execution automatically.
In addition, error messages and screenshots were generated in the pipeline to simplify debugging.

## implementation

- **Test Development:** Created E2E test cases for login, payment, and user interactions
- **Automation:** Integrated the tests into GitHub Actions with parallel execution
- **CI/CD Integration:** Configured automatic test runs on every push or pull request

## results

- Fully automated end-to-end testing for all critical web application components
- Significant reduction of manual testing before deployments
- Faster and more reliable feedback loops during development

## insights

I learned how to **design, implement, and automate end-to-end tests**.
Additionally, I deepened my knowledge of **GitHub Actions** and **CI/CD automation**.

- Experience building stable E2E testing environments
- Advanced knowledge of GitHub Actions
- Improved understanding of test-driven deployment workflows
