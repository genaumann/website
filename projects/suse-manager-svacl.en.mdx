# SUSE Manager Optimization & Migration

## project_overview

The customer operated an extensive SLES infrastructure that was fully managed via **SUSE Manager**.
The goal was to modernize the existing environment, build internal knowledge, and migrate outdated **SLES 12** servers to **SLES 15**.

## challenge

The customer relied exclusively on SLES servers and managed them through SUSE Manager.
In addition, many systems were still running on **SLES 12**, which was nearing the end of its support period.

- Outdated SLES 12 systems
- Limited knowledge about SUSE Manager and Salt
- Partially manual and unstructured configurations

## goals

The goals of the project were:

- Build internal expertise in using SUSE Manager
- Simplify administrative processes for SLES systems
- Migrate SLES 12 systems to SLES 15
- Introduce a modern workflow based on **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

## approach

I started with a **SUSE Manager crash course** to give the customer’s team an overview of key functionalities.
As I strongly prefer the **IaC approach**, I customized SUSE Manager and its underlying **SaltStack** configuration to be managed via an **Azure DevOps staging system**.
I implemented a **staging environment within SUSE Manager** and defined a **development flow** for the ongoing improvement of Salt states.
Together with the customer, we successfully migrated all **SLES 12 systems to SLES 15** using SUSE Manager.

## implementation

- **Crash Course:** Provided an introduction to SUSE Manager fundamentals
- **IaC Setup:** Integrated Azure DevOps and Salt for version-controlled configuration management
- **Staging System:** Implemented a testing and release process within SUSE Manager
- **Migration:** Upgraded systems from SLES 12 to SLES 15
- **Documentation:** Delivered structured operational documentation for long-term use

## results

- The **staging system** and **IaC workflow** I established are still in use today
- Numerous SLES 12 systems were successfully migrated to SLES 15
- The customer can now independently manage SUSE Manager

In **September 2024**, the project was handed over to a colleague following my job transition.

## insights

This project deepened my expertise in **SUSE Manager**, **SaltStack**, and **IaC workflows** within enterprise environments.
I gained hands-on experience in building maintainable, version-controlled Linux infrastructures.

- Experience in developing automation and staging processes with SUSE Manager
- Effective knowledge transfer through practical training sessions
- Strengthened IaC principles in complex enterprise Linux environments
