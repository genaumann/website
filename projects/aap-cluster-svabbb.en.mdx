# Planning and Installation of an AAP Cluster

## project_overview

The customer maintained a large set of custom and complex **Ansible scripts** that were manually executed on specific hosts via the command line.
After acquiring several **Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)** licenses, the goal was to deploy a centralized, scalable automation environment and simplify the existing workflows.

## challenge

Manual execution of Ansible scripts led to inconsistencies and made maintenance difficult.
Additionally, deploying the AAP within the customer’s extensive and security-sensitive enterprise network presented technical challenges.

- Complex, manually executed Ansible scripts
- Lack of centralized orchestration and traceability
- High security and network requirements within the corporate environment

## goals

The goals of the project were:

- Plan, install, and configure an **AAP cluster** in the corporate network
- Optimize and simplify existing Ansible scripts
- Automate the creation of **Execution Environments (EE)** via GitLab
- Enable the customer to operate and extend the AAP independently

## approach

As part of a **team project**, I contributed to the planning, installation, and configuration of the **AAP cluster**.
I refactored and simplified existing Ansible scripts to ensure they could run smoothly within AAP.
To ensure a reliable and repeatable setup, I automated the **build and deployment of Execution Environments (EE)** using the customer’s **GitLab CI infrastructure**.

## implementation

- **Cluster Setup:** Planned, installed, and configured the AAP cluster
- **Script Optimization:** Simplified and adapted Ansible playbooks for AAP compatibility
- **Execution Environments:** Automated EE build and deployment through GitLab CI
- **Integration:** Collaborated with the customer’s IT teams for seamless integration
- **Training:** Delivered knowledge transfer to internal administrators

## results

- The customer now uses the **Ansible Automation Platform** productively and extends automation independently
- The AAP cluster is stable and fully integrated into the enterprise infrastructure
- The customer’s team was successfully enabled through training and documentation

## insights

This project expanded my expertise in **AAP cluster architecture**, **Execution Environments**, and **GitLab automation**.
I gained valuable experience in implementing large-scale enterprise automation platforms.

- Hands-on experience with AAP cluster deployment
- Improved structure and maintainability of Ansible scripts
- Strengthened collaboration between infrastructure and automation teams
