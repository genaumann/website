# GitLab Enablement & Migration

## project_overview

The customer operated a **self-managed GitLab Community Edition** and wanted to upgrade to the **Enterprise Edition** to take advantage of its advanced features.
Additionally, the team lacked experience in setting up and managing **CI/CD pipelines**.
The goal of the project was to perform the migration to the Enterprise Edition and train the employees in the new features and **GitLab CI/CD**.

## challenge

Although GitLab was already in use, only its basic features were being utilized.
Migrating to the Enterprise Edition required clean license integration and a smooth data migration process.
Furthermore, the teams needed to become capable of independently developing and maintaining their own pipelines.

- Migration of an existing GitLab installation
- Lack of knowledge about GitLab CI/CD
- Ensuring proper license activation and system stability

## goals

The project objectives were:

- Migrate the **GitLab Community Edition** to the **Enterprise Edition**
- Train employees in **GitLab administration** and **GitLab CI/CD**
- Build internal expertise for developing and maintaining pipelines
- Ensure full utilization of Enterprise features

## approach

I began with **training sessions** on GitLab and GitLab CI/CD to familiarize the team with key functionalities.
Afterward, I performed the **migration** from the Community Edition to the Enterprise Edition, including license activation and data migration.
Finally, I supported the teams in **creating and optimizing CI/CD pipelines** to put their new knowledge into practice.

## implementation

- **Training:** Introduced GitLab administration, CI/CD fundamentals, runners, and pipeline design
- **Migration:** Upgraded from Community to Enterprise Edition with full license activation
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Created example pipelines and introduced best practices
- **Enablement:** Supported teams with hands-on guidance and project-specific consulting

## results

- Successful migration to the **GitLab Enterprise Edition**
- Teams now actively use **CI/CD** and develop their own pipelines
- Enterprise features are fully utilized
- Sustainable knowledge transfer through practical, hands-on training

## insights

This project deepened my expertise in **GitLab administration**, **CI/CD architecture**, and **Enterprise migrations**.

- Experience migrating GitLab CE to EE
- Effective enablement and training of development teams
- Established robust CI/CD structures for long-term scalability
