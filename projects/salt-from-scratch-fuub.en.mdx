# Introduction of Salt for Server Automation

## project_overview

At that time, around **40 virtual Debian servers** were manually maintained and updated.
This process was time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale.
My goal was to integrate **Salt** into the environment to manage the servers efficiently and standardize configurations through **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

## challenge

Manual administration led to inconsistent configurations and a high maintenance workload.
There was no centralized management or automation in place.

- Approximately 40 servers manually maintained
- No centralized configuration management
- Lack of standardization and reproducibility

## goals

The main goals of the project were:

- Introduce **Salt** as a central management tool
- Automate and standardize server configuration
- Implement an **IaC-based infrastructure management approach**
- Reduce manual maintenance efforts sustainably

## approach

I set up a **Salt master/minion architecture** to centrally manage all systems.
I developed **Salt states** that defined standardized configurations and enabled automated updates.
Through iterative improvements, the environment became stable, maintainable, and easily extendable.

## implementation

- **Setup:** Installed and configured Salt Master and Minions
- **IaC Framework:** Created Salt states to standardize system configuration
- **Automation:** Introduced automatic updates and configuration validation

## results

- Centralized management of all Debian servers using Salt
- Consistent and reproducible configurations across all systems
- The customer continues to use and further develop the setup today

## insights

This project was my introduction to **server automation** with Salt.
I learned how to build a scalable management infrastructure and manage multiple systems efficiently.

- Hands-on experience with Salt and IaC principles
- Improved understanding of automation in multi-server environments
- Long-term enhancement of efficiency and maintainability
