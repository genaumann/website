# Project Management & WebApp Development

## project_overview

In this project, I took on **agile project management** for a small development team while also contributing to the **fullstack development** of a modern web application.
The WebApp was built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, and **GitHub Actions** were used for automated testing and deployment.

## challenge

The team consisted of developers with varying experience levels, making structured communication and coordination key to success.
Additionally, the app had to reach production readiness within a short timeframe, including a robust CI/CD setup.

- Coordinating a small development team
- Delivering a production-ready app under tight timelines
- Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## goals

The goals of the project were:

- Build a performant WebApp using **Next.js**
- Implement automated testing and deployment via **GitHub Actions**
- Foster agile collaboration within the team
- Strengthen my skills in project management and fullstack development

## approach

I led both the **technical direction** and **active development** in the frontend and backend.
The project followed an agile workflow with short sprints, regular reviews, and clearly defined responsibilities.
**GitHub Actions** were integrated for automated testing, linting, and deployment pipelines.

## implementation

- **Frontend & Backend:** Fullstack development with Next.js and TypeScript
- **CI/CD:** Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions
- **Project Management:** Agile planning, sprint reviews, and task tracking
- **Code Quality:** Introduced linting and structured code review processes

## results

- Successfully developed and deployed a stable WebApp
- CI/CD pipeline ensures consistent quality and deployment reliability
- The team achieved high efficiency and autonomy through agile collaboration

## insights

This project significantly improved my **leadership** and **fullstack development** capabilities.
I learned to balance technical execution with team coordination and to apply agile principles effectively in practice.

- Experience in agile project management
- Deeper expertise in Next.js and TypeScript
- Practical understanding of automated workflows with GitHub Actions
