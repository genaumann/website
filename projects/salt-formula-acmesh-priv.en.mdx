# Development of a Salt Formula for acme.sh

## project_overview

I developed a custom **Salt formula** to automate SSL/TLS certificate management using **acme.sh**.
To extend Salt’s capabilities, I also created **custom Salt execution modules in Python**, enabling direct integration with the acme.sh client.
This setup allows certificates to be automatically issued, renewed, and deployed across target systems.

## challenge

The goal was to integrate certificate management into Salt in a **modular, reusable, and version-independent** manner.
Since Salt provides no native support for acme.sh, custom Python modules had to be developed.

- No native acme.sh support in Salt
- Need for reusable and maintainable automation logic
- Ensuring compatibility across different Salt versions

## goals

The goals of the project were:

- Develop a **Salt formula** for automated certificate management using **acme.sh**
- Extend Salt with **custom Python execution modules**
- Implement automated testing against various **Salt versions** using **GitHub Actions**
- Establish a fully automated certificate lifecycle management process

## approach

The formula was designed to handle **certificate requests, renewals, and deployments** through acme.sh.
Custom **Python execution modules** were implemented to interact directly with acme.sh and return structured data to Salt.
A **GitHub Actions pipeline** was set up to automatically test the formula against the latest Salt releases.

## implementation

- **Formula Development:** Created a Salt formula to manage SSL/TLS certificates via acme.sh
- **Python Modules:** Built custom Salt execution modules for issuing and renewing certificates
- **Automation:** Implemented a GitHub Actions CI pipeline for automated cross-version testing
- **Documentation:** Added detailed usage guides and developer documentation

## results

- Fully automated certificate issuance and renewal integrated into Salt
- Extended Salt functionality with Python-based execution modules
- Continuous testing ensures compatibility with all supported Salt versions

## insights

This project strengthened my skills in **Salt module development**, **Python automation**, and **CI/CD integration**.
I gained hands-on experience combining **Infrastructure as Code** with real-world automation challenges.

- Developed custom Salt modules in Python
- Automated certificate management with acme.sh
- Gained a deeper understanding of CI/CD workflows and version testing
