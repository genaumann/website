# Icinga2 Implementation with Salt Integration

## project_overview

At the start of the project, around **50 virtual Linux and Windows servers** were operated without any centralized monitoring system.
Incidents and outages were only reported by end users, often leading to extended downtimes.
To improve system availability, I introduced **Icinga2** — a flexible monitoring solution that works across both Linux and Windows platforms.

## challenge

The lack of monitoring made proactive issue detection difficult.
Outages were often recognized too late, and manually checking all systems was inefficient and unsustainable.

- No centralized monitoring system in place
- Delayed reaction to service disruptions
- High manual effort for system checks

## goals

The main goals of the project were:

- Implement a centralized **Icinga2 monitoring system** for Linux and Windows servers
- Automatically integrate systems managed via **Salt**
- Enable fast detection and notification of system or service failures
- Improve long-term infrastructure stability

## approach

I installed and configured **Icinga2** on a dedicated monitoring server.
All hosts were automatically integrated into Icinga2 through **Salt**.
Key services, processes, and system metrics were continuously monitored.
For Windows servers, I deployed the **Icinga2 Agent** to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## implementation

- **Setup:** Installed and configured Icinga2 on a central monitoring server
- **Integration:** Automated host registration through Salt
- **Windows Support:** Added monitoring for Windows servers using the Icinga2 Agent
- **Notifications:** Set up alerting and escalation for critical incidents
- **Documentation:** Trained and handed over the system to the internal IT team

## results

- Centralized monitoring for approximately 50 servers
- Automatic detection of outages and service issues
- Significantly reduced response times to incidents
- The setup remains in active use and continues to be developed further

## insights

I learned how to design and operate a reliable, automated monitoring system.

- Hands-on experience with Icinga2
- Understanding of monitoring principles and alerting mechanisms
- Implementation of an automated, cross-platform monitoring solution
