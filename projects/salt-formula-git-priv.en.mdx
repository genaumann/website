# Development of a Salt Formula for Git

## project_overview

I developed a custom **Salt formula** that automates the configuration of local Git clients.
The formula enables consistent Git settings across multiple systems, ensuring standardized developer environments.

## challenge

The goal was to create a **reusable and version-independent solution** that remains compatible with multiple Salt releases.

- Ensure compatibility across different Salt versions
- Focus on maintainability and reusability

## goals

The main goals of the project were:

- Develop a **reusable Salt formula** for Git configuration
- Automate testing against multiple **Salt versions**
- Ensure quality, stability, and maintainable code

## approach

The formula was designed with a **modular structure**, using **Jinja templates** and **YAML-based configuration files** for maximum flexibility.
Automated tests were implemented through a **GitHub Actions pipeline**, validating the formula against the latest Salt releases.

## implementation

- **Development:** Created a Salt formula to manage Git configuration (username, email, signing keys, etc.)
- **Automation:** Set up a **GitHub Actions pipeline** to test against multiple Salt versions
- **Quality Assurance:** Added linting, syntax checks, and multi-environment testing
- **Documentation:** Included usage examples and developer notes for easy adoption

## results

- Fully automated and reusable Salt formula for Git client configuration
- Continuous testing via GitHub Actions
- Simplified Git setup for developers and teams

## insights

In this project, I learned how to develop **reusable Salt modules** and integrate **automated testing** for configuration management code.
I also deepened my understanding of **CI pipelines**, **Salt architecture**, and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** best practices.

- Experience in building reusable Salt formulas
- Hands-on experience with automated testing in GitHub Actions
- Strengthened understanding of IaC principles and automation workflows
