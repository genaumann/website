# Automating VM Deployment with Ansible

## project_overview

Our team created several virtual machines every day and configured them manually.
These repetitive tasks consumed multiple hours daily and slowed down the overall workflow.
The goal was to **automate the entire VM creation and configuration process** using Ansible.

## challenge

Manual provisioning of virtual machines was both time-consuming and error-prone.
There was no unified configuration baseline, which led to inconsistent system setups.

- High time consumption due to manual tasks
- Lack of standardized server configurations
- Inconsistent system quality and software versions

## goals

The project objectives were:

- Fully automate VM creation using **Ansible**
- Introduce a **standard configuration** for all new servers
- Train the team to independently provision and configure virtual machines

## approach

I developed an **Ansible playbook** that automated both the deployment and initial setup of new VMs.
A **standard configuration** was created to ensure consistency across all servers.
I also conducted **internal training sessions** to enable team members to perform the process independently.

## implementation

- **Automation:** Created an Ansible playbook for automated VM provisioning
- **Standardization:** Introduced a central configuration template for all servers
- **Training:** Taught the team how to use Ansible for deployment and configuration
- **Optimization:** Documented and extended the solution for multiple VM types

## results

- Significant time savings due to automated processes
- Consistent and reproducible server configurations
- Team members can now independently provision and configure VMs

## insights

This project strengthened my skills in **Ansible automation** and **process standardization**.
I learned how to transform repetitive manual work into efficient, automated workflows and empower teams to adopt them.

- Hands-on experience with VM automation using Ansible
- Improved team efficiency through targeted training
- Established long-term automation practices within daily operations
