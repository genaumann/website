# Migration from Nagios to Icinga2

## project_overview

The customer operated an outdated **Nagios monitoring system**, which needed to be replaced with **Icinga2**.
All existing services and checks were migrated **1:1** to ensure full functionality and continuity.
For improved visualization, **Icinga Web** was installed, providing a modern and user-friendly web interface.

## challenge

The legacy Nagios system was technically outdated and difficult to extend.
The main challenge was to migrate all existing checks without any data loss or downtime.

- Outdated Nagios installation
- Limited scalability and extensibility
- Need for a smooth and interruption-free migration

## goals

The goals of the project were:

- Replace the old **Nagios system** with **Icinga2**
- Migrate all existing services and checks **1:1**
- Introduce a modern web interface using **Icinga Web**
- Build a stable and maintainable monitoring infrastructure

## approach

I installed and configured **Icinga2**, then migrated all existing Nagios services into the new environment.
Additionally, I set up **Icinga Web** to give administrators a clear and organized view of all monitored systems and alerts.

## implementation

- **Installation:** Deployed Icinga2 and Icinga Web on a central monitoring server
- **Migration:** Recreated all Nagios services and checks in Icinga2
- **Visualization:** Integrated Icinga Web for real-time monitoring and alerting

## results

- Successful replacement of Nagios with Icinga2
- Implementation of a modern, web-based monitoring interface
- Improved visibility, maintainability, and extensibility of the system

## insights

This project marked my first experience in **infrastructure monitoring**.
I learned the fundamentals of monitoring systems, alerting mechanisms, and service check configurations.

- First hands-on experience with monitoring tools
- Understanding of alerting and monitoring workflows
- Foundation for further expertise in monitoring automation
